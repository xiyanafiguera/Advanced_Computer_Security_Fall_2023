# Combining Detection-Based and Arithmetic Masking Countermeasures Against Side-channel Attacks on Post-quantum Cryptography

Quantum computing is a highly invested area of research with vast potential across disciplines. At the same time, Quantum computers pose a potential threat for the current classical cryptographic techniques. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has addressed potentials risks by selecting optimal post-quantum cryptography (PQC) methods for standardization. However, the meticulous testing of these methods, particularly their susceptibility to side- channel attacks, remains crucial. For this reason, NIST has prioritized evaluating the resilience of candidate algorithms against such attacks. Recent demonstrations of side-channel attacks on PQC methods employing deep learning have surfaced exploiting vulnerabilities. To mitigate these threats, we propose the implementation of combined detection-based and arithmetic masking-based countermeasures designed to safeguard PQC algorithms against side-channel attacks.
